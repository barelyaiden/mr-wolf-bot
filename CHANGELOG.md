## [1.0.1] - 2023-08-18

A small update to add a few more features to the bot and tweak some commands.

### Added

- A simple README.md file.
- An alternate avatar for the development bot account.
- New members will now automatically receive the "guest" role upon accepting the rules at the Membership Screening.
- The 8-ball command! You can ask it yes or no questions to get varying answers.
- A secret command for Kyle! I sure do wonder what it is...
- A new precondition allowing only Kyle to use a command.

### Changed

- The prefix for commands is now loaded from the configuration file.
- Tweaked the help command to include the prefix next to command names.
- The help command will no longer respond if you try to fetch information about a command that doesn't exist.
